If running from terminal please run from src folder.
Example: cd C:\Users\yiche\new-eclipse-workspace\part2\src
After you are in src folder, run the following command:
java -cp . part2.DecisionTree rtg_A.csv DT_A.txt
Change rtg_A.csv to rtg_B.csv and DT_A.txt to DT_B.txt for the second question.
The classification accuracy should print on terminal and the new DT txt file should also be in src folder.
